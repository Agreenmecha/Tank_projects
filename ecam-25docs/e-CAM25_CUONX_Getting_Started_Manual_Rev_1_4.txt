Introduction to e-CAM25_CUONX 
e-CAM25_CUONX is a 2.3 MP MIPI CSI-2 camera from e-con Systems, a company 
with over two decades of experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing 
OEM cameras.  This camera module targets the NVIDIA® Jetson Orin Nano™/Orin 
NX™ development kit. It can be directly interfaced with Jetson Orin Nano™/Orin 
NX™ development kit through CAM1 and CAM0 connectors. 
e-CAM25_CUONX is provided with S-mount (also known as M12 board lens) lens 
holder. The S-mount is one of the most used small form factor lens mounts for 
board cameras. e-CAM25_CUONX is a color camera that supports uncompressed 
UYVY format in both still capture and video recording. The supported resolutions 
and frame rates are listed in following table.

Description 
Jetson Orin Nano™ and Jetson Orin NX™ are newly launched small size, low power, 
artificial intelligence (AI) system-based evaluation kits, developed by NVIDIA®. Orin 
Nano™/Orin NX™ development kit supports 4-lane/2-lane in CAM1 and 2-lane in 
CAM0 MIPI CSI connector.  e-CAM25_CUONX uses this 4-lane and 2-lane MIPI CSI-2 
interface for connecting 2.3 MP camera module. 
e-CAM25_CUONX is a multi-board solution, which has two boards as follows: 
 Camera module (e-CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD) 
 Adaptor board (ACC-RB-WTB-ADP) 
The camera module is a small, low-power, high performance 2.3 MP camera with a 
built-in Image Signal Processor (ISP), which supports uncompressed UYVY format. 
This camera module is based on AR0234CS CMOS image sensor from onsemi™. The 
AR0234CS is a 1/2.6" optical form factor, CMOS image sensor with global shutter. 
The front and rear views of e-CAM25_CUONX module are shown in following 
figures.

Figure 2: Rear View of e-CAM25_CUONX Module 
e-CAM25_CUONX camera module has 26-pin Samtec connector (CN2) for mating 
with e-CAM25_CUONX adaptor board. e-CAM25_CUONX adaptor board acts as a 
bridge between the camera module and the Jetson Orin Nano™/Orin NX™ 
development kit. The adaptor board provides the voltages required for the camera 
module. e-CAM25_CUONX adaptor board consists of 22-pin FFC connector (CN1), 
through which e-CAM25_CUONX is connected to Orin Nano™/Orin NX™ 
development kits over FPC cable of maximum 15 cm length.
