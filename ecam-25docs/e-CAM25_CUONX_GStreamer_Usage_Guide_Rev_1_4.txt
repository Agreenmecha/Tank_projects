Introduction to G Streamer 
GStreamer is a powerful and flexible multimedia framework with a lot of 
capabilities. It supports various features such as capturing, displaying, encoding, and 
decoding of image data. While using GStreamer, the possibilities of manipulating 
data are limitless. 
The commands and output messages in this manual are represented by different 
colors as shown in below table. 
Table 1: Notation of Colors

This document explains how to install and use Gstreamer-1.0 on the Jetson Orin 
NX™/Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit.

Setup Procedure 
This section describes how to verify the setup before start testing GStreamer 
pipelines. 
To know the details of available plugins, please refer to the Accelerated_Gstreamer 
_User_Guide_Rev_<ver>.pdf from Jetson Download Center. 
The steps to verify the setup before testing GStreamer pipelines are as follows: 
1. Run the following commands to install GStreamer-1.0 binaries and libraries on 
the Jetson Orin Nano™/Orin NX™ development kit. 
$ sudo apt-add-repository universe 
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-l4t-gstreamer 
2. Run the following command to check the Gstreamer-1.0 version. 
$ gst-inspect-1.0 --version 
Output will be shown as below for Jetson Orin Nano: 
gst-inspect-1.0 version 1.20.3 
GStreamer 1.20.3  
https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gstreamer1.0 
Note: Make sure that e-CAM25_CUONX is connected, and the required drivers 
are loaded. 
During booting, the module drivers for e-CAM25_CUONX will be loaded 
automatically in the Jetson Orin™ development kit. 
3. Run the following command to confirm whether the camera is initialized. 
$ sudo dmesg | grep -i "ar0234" 
The output message appears as shown below for Jetson Orin™ development kit. 
subdev ar0234 10-0042 bound 
The output message indicates that the camera is initialized properly. 
4. Run the following command to check the presence of video node. 
$ ls /dev/video* 
The output message appears as shown below. 
/dev/video<X>  
where (*) depends on the number for cameras connected to the Jetson™ 
development kit. The number of video nodes displayed depends on the number 
of cameras connected.

Troubleshooting 
In this section, you can view the commonly occurring issue and its troubleshooting 
step. 
During network streaming, I face issues with video quality and frame rate. How to 
overcome this issue? 
This is a known issue. Network streaming quality and frame rate depends on the 
network bandwidth and receiver decode capability. In the receiver end, if you use 
software decoder, the frame rate and quality will get affected. Therefore, avoid 
using software decoder in the receiver end to resolve this issue. 
During network streaming and recoding the video in Jetson Orin Nano™ 
development kit, I face issues with video quality. How to overcome this issue? 
This is a known issue. Video quality is depending on the encoder used. Jetson Orin 
Nano™ development kit doesn’t have a hardware encoder. If you are using a 
software encoder, the video quality will get affected.
