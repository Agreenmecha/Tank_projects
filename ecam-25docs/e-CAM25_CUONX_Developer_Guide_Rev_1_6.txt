Introduction to e -CAM25_CUONX 
e-CAM25_CUONX is a 2.3 MP MIPI CSI-2 camera from e-con Systems, a company 
with over two decades of experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing 
OEM cameras.. The prebuilt driver for this camera along with the camera board is 
provided by e-con Systems. 
The NVIDIA® Orin Nano™ development kit is a small, powerful computer for 
embedded applications and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Internet of Things (IoT). It is 
pre-flashed with a Linux environment, includes support for many common APIs, and 
is supported by NVIDIA® complete development toolchain. Orin NX™/Orin Nano™ 
platforms supports single camera for 4-lane configuration in cam 1 port only and 
dual camera support in 2-lane configuration. 
e-CAM25_CUONX is 2.3 MP custom lens camera module based on 1/2.6" AR0234CS 
CMOS image sensor from onsemi™. It is a color camera which supports UYVY image 
format and provided with S-mount (also known as M12 board lens) lens holder. The 
S-mount is small form-factor lens mounts for board cameras. e-con Systems 
provides the sample applications that demonstrates the features of this camera. e-
CAM25_CUONX camera is interfaced to J21 connectors of the Orin Nano™ 
development kit using the ACC-RB-WTB-ADP board. However, this camera can also 
be utilized by any Video for Linux version 2 (V4L2) application. 
e-con Systems also provides ecam_tk1_guvcview sample application that 
demonstrates the features of this camera. However, this camera can utilize any 
Video for Linux version 2 (V4L2) application.

Building and Installing Kernel 
The steps to build and install the kernel are as follows: 
1. Run the following commands to build and install the kernel image and modules 
to the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit. 
make -C kernel 
make modules 
sudo -E make modules_install 
make dtbs 
2. Run the following commands to copy the dtbo file to Linux_for_Tegra (L4T_DIR) 
flashing path. 

 
20  e-CAM25_CUONX Developer Guide 
For 2 lane configuration, 
sudo cp $NVIDIA_SRC/kernel-devicetree/generic-
dts/dtbs/tegra234-p3767-0000-p3768-0000-a0-2lane-
ar0234.dtbo $LDK_ROOTFS_DIR/boot 
For 4 lane configuration, 
sudo cp $NVIDIA_SRC/kernel-devicetree/generic-
dts/dtbs/tegra234-p3767-0000-p3768-0000-a0-4lane-
ar0234.dtbo $LDK_ROOTFS_DIR/boot 
Note: Even if the image is custom built, the kernel configuration must have 
module versioning support for the camera driver to work. 
Flashing Orin Nano Development Kit 
The steps to flash the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit are as follows: 
1. Power OFF the kit. 
2. Connect a jumper across FC-REC and GND to enter recovery mode. 
3. Connect the Type-C USB cable to the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit™ and 
host PC. 
The top view of Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit is shown below. 
 
Figure 2: Top View of Jetson Nano Development Kit 
4. Power ON the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit. 
If the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit is successfully changed to recovery 
mode, the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit will be enumerated as an USB 
device to the host PC. 
5. Run the following command to verify whether the Jetson Orin Nano™ 
development kit is in recovery mode. 
lsusb 
The output message appears as shown below.

6. Run the following commands to flash the Jetson Nano™ SOM from Nano™ 
development kit from your host PC. 
cd $L4T_DIR 
1.Flash to NVMe 
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh -- 
external-device nvme0n1p1 -c 
tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_t234_nvme.xml -p "-c 
bootloader/generic/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" --showlogs 
--network usb0 jetson-orin-nano-devkit internal 
2. Flash to the USB 
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh -- 
external-device sda1 -c 
tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_t234_nvme.xml -p "-c 
bootloader/generic/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" --showlogs 
--network usb0 jetson-orin-nano-devkit internal 
3. Flash to SD card 
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh -- 
external-device mmcblk0p1 -c 
tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_t234_nvme.xml -p "-c 
bootloader/generic/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml" --showlogs 
--network usb0 jetson-orin-nano-devkit internal 
 
Note: If you are flashing with a USB flash drive as storage, the USB drive must be 
at least 128GB. 
7. Note: Now, the entire USB drive storage/NVMe on the Jetson Orin Nano™ 
development kit will be erased. Flashing will take about 10-30 minutes to 
complete depending on the host PC configuration. 
8. Connect the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit to a monitor and keyboard. 
9. Reboot the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit to complete the OS 
configuration, once the Jetson Orin Nano™ development kit reboots after 
flashing.

Loading  Drivers 
This section describes how to load the drivers, install the sample application, and 
use the sample application with e-CAM25_CUONX. 
The module drivers for e-CAM25_CUONX will be loaded automatically in the Jetson 
Orin™ development kit during booting. 
The steps to load the drivers are as follows: 
1. Run the following command to select e-CAM25_CUONX device tree 
overlay file for 2 lane. 
sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/config-by-hardware.py -n 
2="AR0234 Sensor 2lane" 
the output message appears as shown below, 
Modified /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf to add following 
DTBO entries: 
/boot/tegra234-p3767-0000-p3768-0000-a0-2lane-
ar0234.dtbo 
Reboot system to reconfigure. 
2.  Run the following command to select e-CAM25_CUONX device tree 
overlay file for 4 lane. 
sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/config-by-hardware.py -n 
2="AR0234 Sensor 4lane" 
the output message appears as shown below, 
Modified /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf to add following 
DTBO entries: 
/boot/tegra234-p3767-0000-p3768-0000-a0-4lane-
ar0234.dtbo 
Reboot system to reconfigure. 
 
2.     Run the following command to check whether the camera is initialized. 
sudo dmesg | grep -i "ar0234" 
The output message appears as shown below for Jetson Orin NX™/Orin Nano™ 
development kit. 
subdev ar0234 10-0042 bound 
The output message indicates that the camera is initialized properly for Jetson 
Orin NX™/Orin Nano™ development kit.

3. Run the following command to check the presence of video node. 
ls /dev/video* 
The output message appears as shown below. 
/dev/video0 
where (*) denotes the number of cameras connected to the Jetson™ 
development kit. 
Note: Only one camera node will be created for Jetson Orin NX™/Orin Nano™ 
development kit since only the CAM1 port on the Jetson Orin Nano™ 
development kit is supported for the 4-lane configuration. 
This video node can be utilized by any V4L2 application for viewing the camera 
preview. 
The login credentials of the Jetson Orin™ development kit are fully configurable 
on the first boot, and the sample login credentials are listed in below table.

Installing Sample Application 
The e-CAM25_CUONX guvcviewer or ecam_tk1_guvcview is a simple GTK+ interface 
for capturing and viewing video from the devices supported on the Jetson Orin™ 
development kit. 
Using guvcviewer or ecam_tk1_guvcview application, you can perform the following: 
• Enumerate and list all the video devices connected. 
• Display properties of video renderer. 
• Change resolution and color space or compression for video stream if different 
resolutions are supported by the device. 
• Display currently configured values of preview. 
• Capture the still images and set the path where still images will be saved. 
• Display the average frame rate. 
All the above listed properties can be configured by attractive and easy to use 
Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
Please refer to the e-CAM_TK1-GUVCView_Build_and_Install_Guide_Rev_<ver>.pdf 
for the procedure to build and install ecam_tk1_guvcview application on the Jetson 
Orin™ development kit.

If that doesn’t work, try disabling auto suspend: 
• To disable autosuspend on your host's USB ports, run the following 
command. 
sudo bash -c 'echo -1 > 
/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/autosuspend' 
Power cycle the development kit and retry flashing. 
Flashing Jetson Orin™ development kit fails with the error, "python: No such file or 
directory". 
To solve this issue, please follow these steps: 
1. Run the following commands to install python 2.7.
