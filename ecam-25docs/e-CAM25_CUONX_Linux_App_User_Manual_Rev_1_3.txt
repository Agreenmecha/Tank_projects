Note: 
• When the exposure time period is more than the time period of camera frame, 
the frame rate will drop. 
• Controls are global across all resolutions and formats, and hence changing the 
control values will reflect the changes in both the formats and resolutions. 
When you select the ROI Based Auto Mode from the Exposure Auto drop-down 
list box, you can view the screen similar to the screen shown below. 
 
Figure 8: ROI Based Auto Mode 
In ROI Based Auto Mode, you can select the ROI and at that region, the exposure 
value will be applied to the entire frame. You can select the required window size 
using the slider of ROI window size control. Click the required region on the preview 
window of the application and based on that region, the exposure will be applied to 
the entire frame. 
The exposure of the image can be varied based on targeted object in the FOV. By 
selecting the ROI Based Auto Mode, you can also select the target object area of the 
frame in guvcviewer display area. The exposure algorithm will calculate the 
automatic exposure adjustment for the selected display area. The ROI region can be 
adjusted by increasing/decreasing the slider of ROI window size control. 
ROI Window Size 
You can change the ROI window size, by moving the slider of ROI window size 
control. The default size is 8. 
For window size 64, the entire frame will be the ROI. If this region exceeds or falls 
below the frame boundary, the ROI will be clipped automatically.
