Introduction to ecam_tk1_guvcview  
e-con Systems is a leading Embedded Product Design Services Company which 
provides ecam_tk1_guvcview sample application for demonstrating the features of 
e-CAM25_CUONX camera. However, this camera can utilize any Video for Linux 
version 2 (V4L2) application. 
The ecam_tk1_guvcview application is based on guvcview, but all the controls are 
performed with GTK+ interface allowing for a more user-friendly Graphical User 
Interface (GUI). This application forms the basic testing tool for the e-
CAM25_CUONX camera. ecam_tk1_guvcview is a V4L2 video viewer and capture 
software for the camera driver of Jetson Orin NX™/Orin Nano™ development kit, 
customized to demonstrate the features of e-CAM25_CUONX.
