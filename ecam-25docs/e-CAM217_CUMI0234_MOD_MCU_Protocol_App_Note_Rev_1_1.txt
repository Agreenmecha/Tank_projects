Introduction to e-
CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD 
e-con Systems is a leading Embedded Product Design Services Company which 
specializes in advanced camera solutions. e-CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD is a new 2-
lane or 4-lane Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI) camera which uses the 
AR0234CS camera module. 
e-CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD is a low voltage, small form factor, high performance 2 
MP pluggable camera module with S-Mount lens holder. It is based on AR0234CS 
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. (CMOS) image sensor from onsemi™. 
e-CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD is designed to connect with any application processor 
that has MIPI interface. The standard S-Mount lens holder can accommodate a wide 
range of lenses based on your choice. 
This document provides a detailed understanding of I2C based protocol used by the 
host application processor, for communicating with the microcontroller which is 
provided as part of e-con Systems e-CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD camera board. 
Description 
e-CAM217_CUMI0234_MOD can stream uncompressed HD at 120 fps, FHD at 65 
fps, 2.3 MP at 60 fps UYVY formats. It can be used with any application processor 
which supports 2-lane or 4-lane MIPI CSI-2 interface. 
This document explains the microcontroller unit (MCU) protocol corresponding to 
the 32-byte MCU firmware version ID mentioned in below table.

Camera Operation Sequence  
This section describes the basic operation for initiating the stream sequence and 
changing the control values using MCU. 
The basic operation for initiating the stream sequence is explained below: 
• Host processor refers to the application processor, for example, Orin Nano™, 
Orin NX™ or FX3 processors will act as I2C Master throughout this protocol. 
• MCU acts as I2C Slave in this entire protocol. 
• The I2C Master always initializes every transaction. 
• Length of the byte sequence between the MCU and host processor is either 
constant or pre-negotiated for each transaction. 
• If a transaction is from host processor to MCU, the host processor will perform 
the following I2C sequence: 
o I2C start condition. 
o 7-bit slave address of MCU. 
o Write bit. 
o Host processor provides data according to the byte sequence defined for 
that specific command. For more details, please refer to the MCU Command 
Description section. 
o I2C stop condition. 
• If a transaction is from MCU to host processor, the host processor will perform 
the following I2C sequence: 
o I2C start condition. 
o 7-bit slave address of MCU. 
o Read bit. 
o MCU will provide data according to the byte sequence specified in the 
command. 
o I2C stop condition. 
• Checksum is calculated by performing bitwise XOR of the payload data which is 
not same as the traditional checksum.

the List of Command Status Codes section to know the various command status 
codes returned by MCU. 
Configure Command 
The configure command is used for starting an operation in the sensor through 
MCU. For example, Lane Config, Stream Config, Set Control Config, Init Cam and so 
on. This command always returns immediately, while MCU executes the request in 
the background. The status of the last issued command can be queried through the 
Get Command Status command. The configure command involves two transactions 
as shown below.
