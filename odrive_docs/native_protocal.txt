Native Protocol
This protocol is what the odrivetool uses to talk to the ODrive. If you have a choice, this is the recommended protocol for all applications. The native protocol runs on USB and on UART.

Python
The odrivetool you installed as part of the Getting Started guide comes with a library that you can use to easily control the ODrive from Python.

Assuming you already installed the odrive library (pip install odrive), the simplest program to control the ODrive is this:

import odrive
odrv0 = odrive.find_any()
print(str(odrv0.vbus_voltage))
For a more comprehensive example, see tools/odrive_demo.py.

Other Languages
We don’t have an official library for you just yet. Check the community, there might be someone working on it. If you want to write a library yourself, refer to the native protocol specification. You are of course welcome to contribute it back.
